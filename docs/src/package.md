# Package

## Installation

The package is still under development and is not available in the official registry. To add this package to your work environment, open julia and type the following commands:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/Samuele-Colombo/FileIO.jl")
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/Samuele-Colombo/ImagePFM.jl")
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/Paolo97Gll/Raytracer.jl")
```

We use a [custom version](https://github.com/Samuele-Colombo/FileIO.jl) of the FileIO package that provides load/save functionalities for pfm files: this integration is done by the package [ImagePFM](https://github.com/Samuele-Colombo/ImagePFM.jl). If FileIO is already present (e.g. the original package), it will be overwritten by this custom version.
